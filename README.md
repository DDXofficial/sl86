# SnakeLauncher86 (sl86) â€” a text-mode 86Box machine manager
This Python script allows you to manage your [86Box](https://86box.net) machines from the command line.
<br/>Originally written with macOS in mind, this script has now been rewritten and extended to officially support Windows and Linux as well.

## Requirements
**Python 3.10** and above is recommended. This has not been tested on older versions.

## Setup
1. Locate your 86Box installation
2. Download the latest release and copy it to your 86Box folder
3. Copy the `launcher.cfg` from the `templates` folder to the root - the script will also do this on first launch
4. Set your app and machine directory paths in `launcher.cfg` - instructions included in said file
5. Run `python launcher.py` or `python3 launcher.py` in your terminal of choice

I am available in the 86Box Discord server (https://discord.86box.net) if you have any questions.
